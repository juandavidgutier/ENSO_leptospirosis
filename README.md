# Project Title

Sea Surface Temperature Modulates ENSO-Driven Leptospirosis Patterns: Evidence from Causal Machine Learning in Colombia

## Description

Code and dataset shared to reproduce the results of the paper Sea Surface Temperature Modulates ENSO-Driven Leptospirosis Patterns: Evidence from Causal Machine Learning in Colombia.
The file data_leptos.csv is the dataset used for the results of the causal machine learning framework presented in the manuscript. 
The file data_DAG.csv is the dataset used for the results of the conditional independences and identification presented in the manuscript. 
The file data_ts.csv is the dataset used for the results of the time series presented in the manuscript. 
To reproduce the results of the conditional independences and identification analysis, use the file dag.R.
To reproduce the results of the time series analysis, use the file TimeSeries.R.
To reproduce the results of the causal machine learning implementation use the file CML_ENSO_leptospirosis.py.
